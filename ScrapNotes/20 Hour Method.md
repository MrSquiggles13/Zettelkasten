# 20 Hour Method

## Notes

- Misconception that 10,000 hours are needed to learn something
- Only true to master a very demanding skill and be the top in said field
- Only need roughly 20 hours to maximize on learning curve on most skills and to be able to get foot in the door
- That is about 45 minutes a day for roughly a month with a few days off here and there
