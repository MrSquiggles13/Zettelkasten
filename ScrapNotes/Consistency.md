# Consistency

## Notes

- Each day is a new person taking control of one's life
- Easier to push things off to tomorrow since "that person" is not you living right now
- Each moment is only controlled by the current "you"
- 
### How to be consistent if we change who we are everyday

- We are attached to who we were in "past selves" since those were a "different self" that we liked in the moment
- Since we are different versions of ourself everyday it creates a fluctuation in priorities, motivations, habits etc.
- Makes it easier to leave obligations and responsibilities for future you to deal with
- Future discounting: a part of brain called _nucleus accumbens_ that is wired to value things that are immediate more than things that are distant i.e. a dollar today is more valuable than two dollars a year from now
- We are inheriting this life from the person who came before us (yesterday) and we are custodians of this life for the person who comes next (tomorrow)
- What kind of life do you want to set up for the person tomorrow?
- If this doesn't matter the need for self compassion and self love arises
- One only makes sacrifices for things that are worth it
- If this is absent why would one make sacrifices for future self if one does not value oneself (Does one want to set up tomorrow's self for failure or success?)
- Consistency is an illusion since there is no inherent consistency within the self since the self is different day to day. This paradox builds a compassion chain for tomorrow's inhabitant since one can have compassion for tomorrow's self's trials and tribulations building a consistency of love and self worth
