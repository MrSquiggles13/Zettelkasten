# Notes on acquired knowledge
---
#### I will have many different subjects of interest in here but the main ones will be...

---
## Computer Science

	I have had many a learning journey through the last four years with Computer Science in general and hope to expand on this

---
## Mathematics

	Maths has been a strong suite of mine but seem to lose this knowledge over time of not applying it. Which is a shame since it could help me a lot with my coding projects

---
## Psychology/Neuroscience

	The study of the brain has always incited fascination within myself yet my knowledge in it is few and far between. Hopefully this new note taking adventure will help organize this into a comprehensible and useable resource.

---
## Biology

	An interest of mine that is mostly fleeting but seems like it could e useful

---
## Chemistry

	I feel as though understanding the building blocks of everything will help with some insights in other fields I am interested in (also my father is a chemist so that might be a part of it)

---
## Physics

	Coming back to programming/computer science physics is pinnacle to game development which was my first passion in the field. I hope to also understand the math and algorithms behind it to help with understanding more in math/comp-sci in general

---
## Other

	I wouldn't be able to list everything for sure but I am hoping to make this like my second brain. Ever expanding on all regions of knowledge and interconnecting it all to draw out an expansive web that can enhance my understanding of, well, everything.

## Conclusion

	This is going to be an ongoing process and long over-do but I am excited to start this journey that I hope will help me with my endeavors.

	It will not be easy and it will take a good bit before it has any real functionality or impact but I believe this is going to help organize my chaotic mind and help me finally draw everything together and hopefully retain information in a better fashion than what I was doing prior (Oh I'll just remember it). I don't believe in luck per se but I am definitely going to wish myself the best and if somehow someway someone else sees this I wish you the best as well.
