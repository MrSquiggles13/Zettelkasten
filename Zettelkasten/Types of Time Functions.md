# Types of Time Functions

## Notes

![[TimeComplexityGraph.jpg | 500]]
#### Constant O(1)
- The execution of the algorithm is a set number of times that does not vary
#### Logarithmic O(log(n))
- Takes about the same time to execute relative to input after a certain magnitude
#### Linear O(n)
- The time it takes to execute algorithm is equivalent to the input
#### Quadratic O(n$^2$)
- Execution time is doubled for each increment of input taken in
#### Cubic O(n$^3$)
- Execution time is tripled for each increment of input taken in
#### Exponential O(2$^n$)
- Execution time that increases rapidly relative to input

Order of efficiency:
1 < log(n) < $\sqrt{n}$ < n < n(log(n)) < n$^2$ < n$^3$ . . . < 2$^n$ < 3$^n$ . . . < n$^n$
