# Heapify

## Notes

A process used to create a heap

![[Pasted image 20240307011737.png]]
First a binary tree is made using a list of elements

Each element from leaf up is treated separately as its own heap and sorted accordingly

When the root of the binary tree is reached the binary tree will be converted into a heap

The time complexity of heapify is $O(n)$ since the time taken is dependent on the n number of elements in the list being converted to a heap
