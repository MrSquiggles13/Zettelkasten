# Characteristics of an Algorithm

## Notes

| 1. | Input |
| ---- | ---- |
| 2. | Output |
| 3. | Definiteness |
| 4. | Finiteness |
| 5. | Effectiveness |
#### Input
- Zero or more pieces of information, or data, applied to the algorithm
#### Output
- One or more pieces of information that is generated by the algorithm
- An algorithm **_MUST_** Generate an output of at least one piece of information even if the information is nothing (void, none, null, etc.)
#### Definiteness
- Straight forward and concise with their meaning, non-convoluted
- Solvable and have a clear path to an output
- Utilized for a specific task and only that task
#### Finiteness
- Can not run forever, has to terminate and give an output after a certain amount of time i.e. can not run infinitely
#### Effectiveness
- Direct and useful statements, each one having a purpose
- Statements are to be optimized and benefit the algorithm as a whole
