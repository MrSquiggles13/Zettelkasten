# How to Analyze an Algorithm

## Notes

| 1. | Time |
| ---- | ---- |
| 2. | Space |
| 3. | NS/DT |
| 4. | Power |
| 5. | CPU |
#### Time
- How long the algorithm takes to run
- Find ways to make time consumption more efficient
- Each statement takes one unit of time
#### Space
- How much memory the algorithm takes to run
- Try to reduce space without sacrificing the efficiency of the other parts of the algorithm
- Each variable takes one unit which is defined as a _word_ i.e. 3 variables in an algorithm is 3 words
#### Network Consumption/Data Transfer
- The delay and efficiency of the transfer of information between machines or programs
- Reducing the latency while increasing the bandwidth is ideal
#### Power Consumption
- The amount of wattage a machine takes to run
- Reduce the amount by making a device more efficient in its use of power while also giving off less heat
#### CPU Register Use
- The utilization of the memory modules in a CPU
- More effectively use the registers in a way that does not overwork them or cause memory loss/constraints
