# Algorithm

## Notes

A sequence of instructions that help solve a dynamic problem.

- Usually applied in mathematics and computer science
- Fundamental in software development and engineering
- Used in dynamic programming

Part of the design process that helps build structure to the system being built and emplaced

Should be implemented by those with the fundamental knowledge in the field in which the problem does occur

Should be written in a way that is clear an concise and not necessarily in a programming format or dependent on any type of system ie syntax or system
