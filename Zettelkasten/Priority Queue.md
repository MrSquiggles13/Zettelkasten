# Priority Queue

## Notes

![[Pasted image 20240307013947.png]]

A priority queue is similar to a standard queue except instead of first-in-first-out method for insertion and deletion each element is set with a priority on insertion and on deletion the element with the highest priority is the target

The time complexity for insertion and deletion is $O(n)$ since both methods could require a shift of the entire array
