# Steps to Write an Algorithm

## Notes

Some algorithms are written in a pseudo C syntax but does away with any unnecessary steps that would only be applicable in an actual C program i.e. declaring variables, giving variables data types

_$Example:$_
```
Algorithm swap(a, b){
	temp <-- a;
	a <-- b;
	b <-- a;
}

OR

Algorithm swap(a, b)
BEGIN
	temp = a
	a = b
	b = a
END
```

Can be written in any format as long as it is consistent and follows the [[Characteristics of an Algorithm]]

As seen above needs to be definitive and readable for humans to understand its functionality
