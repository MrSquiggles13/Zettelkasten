## Overview

I am using this document to find, build, and refine my note taking strategy

Using the Zettelkasten system in a manner that fits what works with me as well in a way that I understand it should help hone in on an effective learning system

## Methodology

- Zettelkasten system should be a self organizing system that will manifest connections and grouping of information
- Each group should be only one step outside of the core idea
- Any link should be directly connected to that idea. If the topics are broad are obscurely linked there should be intermediaries that help tie the ideas together
	- Example: Computer Science and Electrical Engineering are linked for sure but how? Well Electrical engineering uses circuitry and electricity to build components that can be utilized for Computer Hardware. This hardware can then be used for certain types of logic that computer science abstracts away.
	- A tree of connections could look like Electrical Engineering -> Circuitry -> Logic Gates -> Microcontrollers -> CPUs -> Computer Science
	- This example is not perfect but it well help with a base line to make note taking more logical and have more intelligent connections
- Any fleeting idea or subconscious connection/idea should be taken down immediately and added as a note later
- Have Fun!! Learning should be fun and making these connections by taking notes and making the links should be personal and exciting to get done. Sure some days are going to be hard and the motivation will not be there but I have to be consistent and see the joy in building a functioning system to help with organizing the knowledge of my interests. 

## Taking Notes

- Notes should be somewhat short and concise
- All information inside note should relate directly to the topic
- Anything that relates indirectly to the topic or needs a large description should be a different note

## Linking

- Links should have a direct connection
- Can be changed later on to organize ideas better
- Should be revaluated periodically i.e. after each lesson

## Sources

- Sources should have their own layout note as well as individual reference note for each topic if there is more than one
- Note on sources themselves should be a brief overview with ideas derived from said source having their own respective notes


## Miscellaneous

- Be consistent with note taking
- Get used to taking notes on anything that seems interesting to oneself
- Organization should be organic through links and sources
